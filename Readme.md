# Happy new year Node.js people!

We are engineers, hackers, fathers, brothers, sons and lovers. But we really do care
about technology. We do care about people. That's why we are changing the world
that we live in for good. Together we are strong. Together we can succeed.

Thank you for being such a great community!
